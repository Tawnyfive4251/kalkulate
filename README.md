# kalkulate
 Modern Calculator App with Encrypted File Storage
##*introduction*
*want to hide that 100gb "homework folder" from someone? Just like having a cool calculator? Kalkulate is the program for you.*

Kalkulate is a file-encrypting calculator that allows you to hide files safely and discretely. The app uses advanced encryption to make sure nobody touches your super
secret kalkulations.

##*how to use*
As a calculator: Just make your calculations! Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

As a secret file browser: Start by entering the code "88224646+-" onto the calculator. If it is the first time you are
using Kalkulate, there will be a prompt which tells you to enter the "Kombination". **NOTE: *This combination is NOT able
to be reset. Set a code that you and only you can remember.*** There will be a confirmation dialog, which you can confirm by hitting the + button or retry by hitting the - button.
To enter your vault again, simply enter your code at any point and hit the + button three times. 

After entering the vault, you are able to store encrypted files in a hidden folder of the root folder. Remember, the Kombination is directly tied to the
encryption and nobody would be able to recover the documents if the Kombination is lost.
